      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Bright Abety and I'm currently a Quality Technician based in Concord, MA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a recent graduate of the University of New Hampshire with a Bachelor's of Science in Genetics, and I currently work as a Lab Technician at Plug Power Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy working out, listening to music, and coding. I'm also currently enrolled in a Full Stack Bootcamp program at UNH.
      </p>
